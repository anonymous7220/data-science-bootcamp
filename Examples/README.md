# Practical Examples & Projects

This directory contains **practical exercises and mini-projects** where theoretical concepts are applied to real-world scenarios.

It covers the full data pipeline including **data cleaning, visualization, and modeling**.

## Important Note: Datasets

To optimize the repository size, large datasets (e.g., `.csv`, `.xlsx` files) are generally **NOT included** in this repository.

** regarding missing files:**
Since some of these projects are from earlier learning stages, **certain specific CSV files may no longer be available** in the archive. 
* In such cases, the code serves as a **logic and syntax reference**.
* If you wish to run them, you may need to substitute the missing file with a compatible dataset of your own.

**How to run standard examples:**
1.  Download the required dataset (e.g., Titanic, Housing Prices) from Kaggle.
2.  Place the file in the same directory.
3.  Update the `pandas.read_csv("filename.csv")` path if necessary.
